Converting the Kenwood TK-931 to the Amateur 902 MHz band

This is a document that I created in December 1996 when making the Kenwood TK-931 work in the 902 Amateur Radio band. I stumbled across it and hope that it might help others.  The techniques are probably similar to what you would see in today's radios.
